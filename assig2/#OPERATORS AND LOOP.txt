#OPERATORS AND LOOP

1. Conditional Operators in java are those operators that checks some conditions before execution. There are three types of conditional operator - AND operator(&&), OR operator(||) and Ternary Operator(? :).

2. There are three types of operator based on the number of the operator 
	a. Unary operator
	b. Binary operator
	c. Ternary operator

3. Switch case in java programming is used for selecting one particular statement out of many statements ro execute. There is a use of Break keyword that ensure that only one required statement get executed and then it come out of the whole part.

4. The priority levels of the arithematic operations in java-
	Higher priority - (* / %)
	Lower priority = (+ -)

5. Conditional statements are those statements that execute if the condition is true otherwise fails to execute that statement. In if-else condition if the statement is true then it will execute the statement written in if condition else execute the statement written in else part.

6. The syntax of if - else statement is -

	if( condition){
		//statement to execute
				}
	else{
		//statement to execute
				}

7. The three type of iterative statements in java are
	a. for loop
	b. while loop
	c. do while loop

8. Difference between while loop and do while loop are-
	i. In while loop statements are executed after condition is checked whereas in do-while loop firstly 	  	   statements are execute then condition is checked.
	ii. While loop may run for zero times but do-while loop has to execute atleast one time.

9. Program to print numbers from 1 to 10.

	public class number {
    			public static void main(String[] args)
    			{
        			System.out.println("Printing Number from 1 to 10");

        			for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
        				{
            					System.out.println(i);
        				}
   			 }
	}
